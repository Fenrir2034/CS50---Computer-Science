# Huffman Coding Project
#### https://youtu.be/jISrX5zlveo
#### Description:
Overview

This Huffman Coding project is a C implementation of the Huffman coding algorithm, a lossless data compression algorithm used to compress data by assigning variable-length codes to input characters. The goal is to provide an efficient and compact representation for characters based on their frequencies in the input data.

The project consists of two main files: main.c and huffman.c. The main.c file contains the main function, test cases, and the execution flow of the program. On the other hand, huffman.c contains the implementation of the Huffman coding algorithm, including functions for building the Huffman tree, generating Huffman codes, and printing the results.

File Structure

main.c

The main.c file serves as the entry point of the program. It includes the necessary header files, including the one containing the Huffman coding implementation. The main function orchestrates the execution flow by first demonstrating the Huffman coding example with a set of characters and frequencies. Afterward, it runs additional test cases through the runTests function, showcasing the flexibility and adaptability of the Huffman coding implementation.

huffman.c

The huffman.c file encapsulates the core functionality of the Huffman coding algorithm. It defines structures for representing nodes in the Huffman tree, a min-heap data structure, and functions for building the tree, generating codes, and printing the results. The HuffmanCodes function is the primary interface for users to generate Huffman codes based on input data and frequencies.
Implementation Details

The Huffman coding algorithm begins by constructing a Huffman tree based on the frequency of each character in the input data. The tree is built using a min-heap data structure to efficiently select and merge nodes. Once the tree is constructed, the Huffman codes are generated by traversing the tree, assigning '0' for left edges and '1' for right edges. The final step involves printing the characters along with their corresponding Huffman codes.
Design Choices

    Modularity: The project is designed with modularity in mind. The separation of the main program (main.c) and the Huffman coding implementation (huffman.c) allows for easy maintenance and potential reuse of the Huffman coding module in other projects.

    Testability: The inclusion of a runTests function in the main.c file demonstrates the testability of the Huffman coding implementation. This structure allows users to add and run additional test cases easily.

    Readability: The code is structured to enhance readability and comprehension. Descriptive variable and function names, along with comments, are used to guide the reader through the implementation. The choice to split the implementation into separate functions contributes to code readability and maintainability.

Testing and Verification

To ensure the correctness of the Huffman coding implementation, a set of test cases is provided within the runTests function in the main.c file. Each test case includes different input data and frequencies, allowing users to verify that the algorithm produces the expected Huffman codes.
Usage

    Compilation: Navigate to the project directory in the terminal and compile the code using the following command:

    bash

gcc main.c -o main

Execution: Run the compiled program:

bash

    ./main

The program will output the Huffman codes for the provided characters and frequencies, including any additional test cases added to the runTests function.
Conclusion

In conclusion, this Huffman coding project provides a clear and modular implementation of the Huffman coding algorithm in the C programming language. The choice of separating the main program from the Huffman coding implementation promotes modularity, testability, and readability. Users can easily understand the code structure, run test cases, and integrate the Huffman coding module into their projects.
